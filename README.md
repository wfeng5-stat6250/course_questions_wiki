- Question (IL): What's the difference between starting a SAS program with "data" versus "proc", and why do both end types of programs end with the same "run" command, even though the bodies of the programs look nothing alike?
- Answer (IL): SAS programs are divided into "steps", each step is either a data step or a proc step (as determined by the first word in the step), and all steps are typically terminated by a "run" statement. However, when using a "cards" or "dataline" statement in a data step, then the data step is terminated by a closing semicolon. In addition, some procs (like the interactive proc glm) are only terminated with a "quit" statement.
